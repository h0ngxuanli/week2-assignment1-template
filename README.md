# Week 2 assignment

_Python Bootcamp for Data week 2 assignment_

This week, you learned how to create functions, classes, and methods. These are the basis of almost any program you might create with Python. Functions and classes are useful for organizing code, increasing maintainability and code reuse. You'll use that knowledge to complete the assignment in this repository.

> ðŸ’¡ This template repository is made for GitHub Classroom delivery, but can be used independently if you want to learn on your own.

## Assignment instructions

This repository uses automated grading (or testing). When starting, all automated tests will fail. Your task is to make them all pass.

1. Open [main.py](./main.py) and address each of the problems defined in the comment blocks
1. Make your changes and push them the repository.
1. Watch the tests results in the [actions](/../../actions) tab of your repository. Every push will trigger the autograding.
1. Repeat the fix/push/verify cycle until all tests are passing and the [actions](/../../actions) tab shows a green.

> ðŸ’¡ As part of the GitHub Classroom setup, you might get an automated Pull Request created for direct feedback by your Professor or by the TAs.

**Verify your work** by running `pytest -v` in the root of your repository. If you are using Codespaces, `pytest` will already be installed for you and available for you to run tests that are used for auto-grading.

This assignent is for week 2 (out of 4) of the Python Bootcamp for Data. The whole course has four weeks:

- [week 1: Introduction to Python](https://github.com/alfredodeza/introduction-to-python)
- [Week 2: Python Functions and Classes](https://github.com/alfredodeza/python-functions-and-classes)
- [Week 3: Testing In Python](https://github.com/alfredodeza/python-testing/)
- [Week 4: Introduction to Pandas and Numpy](https://github.com/alfredodeza/pandas-and-numpy)

## Bonus challenge
Open the [bonus](./bonus) directory and then look into the [main.py](./bonus/main.py) file. It has almost the same code as the previous bonus challenge. You will need to follow the instructions in the comments to add functions and classes. This bonus assignment is not graded and will not trigger auto-grading. It is meant to be a challenge for you to practice what you learned in the course.
